# ATmegaPr1
On the document Operation1.asm the goal was to implement simple operations of input and output of data testing out the ATmega128.
On Operation2.asm the aim was to develop knowledge about sequences, switches and functions.
On Operation3.asm it is represented a example to consolidate all the knowledge from the other files and solve a problem which was:
Creating a simulation of controling the people access to a room with a m√°x capacity of 9 people. A entry and exit is made on the same location being detected by the sensors 'S1' and 'S2'. When the capacity limit is reached, the door 'PE (D8)' must be closed to  prevent more people from entering. The rightmost display should show the number of vacant spots at the room. The room's light 'LS(D7)' must be of off when empty. The sensors 'S1' and 'S2' are set with an offset of 90 degrees for the detection of entry and exit of people. When a person enters the room, first activates 'S1' then 'S2', while at the exit, it is activated first 'S2' and then 'S1'. To determine the activation of the sensors it should be made, for each one, two readings with a range of 1 ms and both should have the same logical value to be considered a valid reading.
